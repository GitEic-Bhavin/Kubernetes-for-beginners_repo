Let us try that. Upgrade the application by setting the image on the deployment to kodekloud/webapp-color:v2


Do not delete and re-create the deployment. Only set the new image name for the existing deployment.

kubectl edint deploument frontend

Look for image: & replade with kodekloud/webapp-color:v2
