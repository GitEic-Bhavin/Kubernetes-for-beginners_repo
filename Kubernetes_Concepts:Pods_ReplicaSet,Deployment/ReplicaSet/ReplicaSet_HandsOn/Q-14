Fix the original replica set new-replica-set to use the correct busybox image.


Either delete and recreate the ReplicaSet or Update the existing ReplicaSet and then delete all PODs, so new ones with the correct image will be created.

kubectl edit replicaset new-replica-set 

 spec:
      containers:
      - command:
        - sh
        - -c
        - echo Hello Kubernetes! && sleep 3600
        image: busybox
